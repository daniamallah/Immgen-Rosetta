# ImmGen Rosetta Browser 

This repository hosts the source code and visualization components for the **ImmGen Rosetta Browser**, a web-based tool designed for exploring cell-type-resolved transcriptional profiles from the **Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen)**.

---

##  Overview

The **ImmGen Rosetta Browser** provides a unified interface for querying, comparing, and visualizing gene-expression patterns across immune cell lineages.  
This repository contains the scripts and functions that power its data processing, normalization, and interactive visualization layers.

Core features include:
- Dynamic exploration of **RNA-seq** and **Cite-seq** datasets across immune subsets  
- Integrated gene-to-cell-type mapping with ImmGen metadata  
- Interactive heatmaps, volcano plots, and UMAP visualizations
